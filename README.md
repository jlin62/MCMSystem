# MCMSystem
This application includes designing and implementation of Monash Conference Management (MCM) system.
The application will be used by conference organisers to allow paper submission from authors, allocate reviewers to submitted papers, and make decisions on the paper status through using a Java-based GUI client.
In this assignment, I created an Oracle Database from NetBeans IDE and use Java code to manage the database through a user friendly interface. The client application and operations were implemented in NetBeans using MVC.
